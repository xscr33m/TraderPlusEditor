# xscr33m's TraderPlusEditor - The Original -
Editor for the amazing [TraderPlus](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2458896948) Mod by [Dmitri060](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dmitri060). 
This editor is intended to facilitate the editing of the PriceConfig. 
The .json file is very fragile - one comma too much or one space in the wrong place and the whole mod doesn't work anymore. 
With this editor formatting errors are a thing of the past.
