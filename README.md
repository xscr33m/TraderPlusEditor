# xscr33m's TraderPlusEditor - The Original -
Editor for the amazing [TraderPlus](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2458896948) Mod by [Dmitri060](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dmitri060). 
This editor is intended to facilitate the editing of the PriceConfig. 
The .json file is very fragile - one comma too much or one space in the wrong place and the whole mod doesn't work anymore. 
With this editor formatting errors are a thing of the past.


## How-To-Use

   1. download the latest release of [xscr33m's TraderPlusEditor.zip](https://github.com/xscr33m/TraderPlusEditor/releases)  →→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→→
   2. Unzip the TraderPlusEditor.zip file using 7Zip or another program.
   3. Run TraderPlusEditor.exe located inside the TraderPlusEditor folder.
   4. Click on "Load File" and select your TraderPlusPriceConfig.json.
   5. Enjoy editing the prices.
   6. When you are finished editing, simply click "Export File". A new TraderPlusPriceConfig.json will be created in the export folder, which you can access using the "Open Export Folder" button.
   7. Replace the old TraderPlusPriceConfig.json on your server with the new one.
